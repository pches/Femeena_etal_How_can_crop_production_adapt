#This script by created as part of the PCHES (Program on Coupled Human and Earth Systems) project
#studying the impact of unsustainable groundwater restrictions on crop production in the US West
#The project is funded by the Department of Energy

#This script was developed during the final stages of the project (2024-2025)
#Last updated in March 2025

# This script is used to plot fraction of maximum yield versus sustainable fraction of full irrigation for multiple states in the US West, as provided in Figure 3 of the submitted manuscript 
# All the input files needed to run this script and output files generated are listed in the MetaData file
